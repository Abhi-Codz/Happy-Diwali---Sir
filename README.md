# Happy-Diwali---Sir
This is a greeting to everyone for the occasion of DIWALI...Even though there is not too much stuff in coding but I really did a lot of hardwork mindstorming and creating the images for every frameâ€¦Most importantly this is made for my teacher whose language of origin is Odiya..
